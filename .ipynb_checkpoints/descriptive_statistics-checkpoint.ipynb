    "## Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with identifying data types as either categorical or quantitative. We then learned we could identify quantitative variables as either continuous or discrete. We also found we could identify categorical variables as either ordinal or nominal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing categorical variables, we commonly just look at the count or percent of a group that falls into each level of a category. For example, if we had two levels of a dog category: lab and not lab. We might say, 32% of the dogs were lab (percent), or we might say 32 of the 100 dogs I saw were labs (count).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the 4 aspects associated with describing quantitative variables are not used to describe categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantitative Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we learned there are four main aspects used to describe quantitative variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Measures of Center\n",
    "2.Measures of Spread\n",
    "3.Shape of the Distribution\n",
    "4.Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at calculating measures of Center\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Medians\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Interquartile Range\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that we could calculate the variance as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1/n SUM(n=1 to n)(Xi-Xbar)^2\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see:\n",
    "\n",
    "1/(n-1) SUM(n=1 to n)(Xi-Xbar)^2\n",
    " \n",
    "The reason for this is beyond the scope of what we have covered thus far, but you can find an explanation here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can commonly find answers to your questions with a quick Google search. Now is a great time to get started with this practice! This answer should make more sense at the completion of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation vs. Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. In practice, you usually use the standard deviation rather than the variance. The reason for this is because the standard deviation shares the same units with our original data, while the variance has squared units."

    "\n",
    "When outliers are present we should consider the following points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Noting they exist and the impact on summary statistics.\n",
    "(I.e. greatly increase in our mean or standard deviation)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If typo - remove or fix\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Understanding why they exist, and the impact on questions we are trying to answer about our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reporting the 5 number summary values is often a better indication than measures like the mean and standard deviation when we have outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Be careful in reporting. Know how to ask the right questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single number can be very misleading about what is actually happening in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outliers Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are my guidelines for working with any column (random variable) in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot your data to identify if you have outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handle outliers accordingly via the previous methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If no outliers and your data follow a normal distribution - use the mean and standard deviation to describe your dataset, and report that the data are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Side note*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't sure if your data are normally distributed, there are plots called normal quantile plots and statistical methods like `the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test` that are aimed to help you understand whether or not your data are normally distributed. Implementing this test is beyond the scope of this class, but can be used as a fun fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you have skewed data or outliers, use the five-number summary to summarize your data and report the outliers.\n",
